            <h3>Full-time Software Engineer - Kirkland, WA</h3>
            <h4>Why Hell There, I'm Armeen! What Iâ€™m most passionate about learning<br></br> in a tech environment is that technology is constantly developing<br></br> and changing, and as a result, when technology improves and changes,<br></br> it allows me to learn more and gain new tools to add to my personal<br></br> toolkit. I'm enthralled by the prospect of learning new skills while<br></br> also putting my existing ones to use. Learning challenges me and keeps<br></br> me on my toes. Family, health, and soccer are just a few of my<br></br> other passions.</h4>
